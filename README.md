# Group Project: Image Classification using CNNs

## Objective:
To develop an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for a specific domain, and to evaluate the performance of different CNN architectures.

## Group Formation:
Form a group of 2 to 3 students per group. Assign the following roles among group members:

* **Data Engineer**
* **Data Scientist**
* **Data Analyst**

## Roles and Responsibilities:

### Data Engineer:
* Collect and prepare the dataset
* Standardize the data
* Create a dataset for the chosen domain

### Data Scientist:
* Create and train three different CNN models (ResNet50, Dense121, MobileNetv3)
* Perform hyperparameter tuning (transfer learning)
* Train each model for 50 epochs

### Data Analyst:
* Visualize the dataset to identify classes and labels
* Understand the dataset to achieve the goals
* Visualize the performance of the trained models

## Domain Selection:
Choose one of the following domains for your project:

* Forestry
* Medical imaging
* Agriculture health
* Animal subspecies
* Plant subspecies

## Dataset Preparation:

* Use web crawler tools to collect up to 10,000 images
* Ensure at least 3 classes (up to 10 classes) in the dataset
* Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing datasets

## Data Modelling:

* Use three different CNNs: ResNet50, Dense121, MobileNetv3 (available in Keras library)
* Train each model for 50 epochs
* Use two metrics to evaluate model performance: accuracy and mAP (mean average precision)
* Record the training time for each model

## Data Visualization:

* Visualize the performance of each model
* Show graphs for model loss and accuracy
* Display evaluation using confusion matrix
* Evaluate the performance of the model against the testing dataset
* Draw conclusions on which model is best suited for the classification task, considering model parameters, accuracy, mAP, and training time

## Presentation:
Prepare a 5-minute presentation to showcase your results.
